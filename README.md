## Code and maps for the 2024 30-Day Map Challenge

I had a good time with this last year, so I've decided to do the [2024 30-Day Map
Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/). This repository contains the code and maps I've created during this challenge.

## Day 1: Points

#### Map: Give Me That Old Time Religion: Houses of Worship in Brevard County, Florida by Year of Construction as of 2022

![Day 1: Points](day1_points/day1_points.png?raw=true "Give Me That Old Time Religion")

For my first map, I returned to my roots in Brevard County, Florida, like I did last year. This time, I elected to visualize the religious buildings in the county by 20-year interval of construction. The data is sourced from 
the [Florida Geographic Data Library](https://fgdl.org/ords/r/prod/fgdl-current/catalog), specifically [this dataset](https://fgdl.org/meta/GC_RELIGION.xml).

## Day 2: Lines

#### Map: Rainbow Road: Roads in Tallahassee, Florida by Function as of 2024

I did my undergraduate studies at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, and that provided the inspiration for my Day 2 map this year. This data comes from the
[Tallahassee-Leon County GeoData Hub](https://geodata-tlcgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/46349cf3c14142be8f0558a880570e43_0/explore?location=30.449045%2C-84.281911%2C11.91).

## Day 3: Polygons

#### Map: The Measure of One's Character(s): County Name Lengths in the United States

![Day 3: Polygons](day3_lines/day3_lines.png?raw=true "County Name Lengths")

This map is shaded based on how many non-whitespace characters are in each county or county-equivalent name in the U.S.

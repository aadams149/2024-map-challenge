## Code and maps for the 2024 30-Day Map Challenge

I had a good time with this last year, so I've decided to do the [2024 30-Day Map
Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/). This repository contains the code and maps I've created during this challenge.

## Day 1: Points

#### Map: Give Me That Old Time Religion: Houses of Worship in Brevard County, Florida by Year of Construction as of 2022

For my first map, I returned to my roots in Brevard County, Florida, like I did last year. This time, I elected to visualize the religious buildings in the county by 20-year interval of construction. The data is sourced from 
the [Florida Geographic Data Library](https://fgdl.org/ords/r/prod/fgdl-current/catalog), specifically [this dataset](https://fgdl.org/meta/GC_RELIGION.xml).
